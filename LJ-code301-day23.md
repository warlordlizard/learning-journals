This course has been tough.  Functional programming (.map, .filter, .reduce), lexical arrow functions, templating, ajax, building servers and routing.

I just finished my 401 entrance exam got 22/30 answers correct. not my best showwing but show I understand about 3/4 of the things being thrown at me.

routing is probably the hardest part yet, still trying to learn that.
